Data Studio Star Rating Visualization

This is a visualization that exactly does what it states ;) It displays Stars. Period. But of course it also has some bells & whistles e.g.
* Support for dimensions
* Hiding of Metric and or Dimension name
* Adding custom Paddings, Fonts and Colors
* Altering the stars look and of course
* add as many stars as you like (and who doesn't like more stars? ;)
